This strategy is based on the principle of reciprocity, where the player tries to mimic the action of the other player in the previous round.\n\nAdditionally, this strategy also takes into account the concept of \"betrayal aversion\" which refers to the tendency of people to prefer reciprocity over self-interest, especially when they feel betrayed by the other player's action in the previous round.
