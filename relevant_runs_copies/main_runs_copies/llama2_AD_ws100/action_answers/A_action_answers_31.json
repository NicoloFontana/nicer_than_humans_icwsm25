The total payoff for A is 41, and for B is 51. If A continues to play defect, the best outcome for A would be to get 1 point for each of the remaining 6 rounds, which would result in a total payoff of 47. However, there is a chance that B might play cooperate in one of the remaining rounds, in which case A would get 0 points for that round. Therefore, the maximum payoff A can expect by playing defect is 47.\n\nOn the other hand, if A plays cooperate, there is a chance that B might play cooperate as well, in which case A would get 3 points for that round, resulting in a total payoff of 44 + 3 = 47. Additionally, if B plays defect, A would still get 1 point for that round, resulting in a total payoff of 44 + 1 = 45. Therefore, the maximum payoff A can expect by playing cooperate is 47, which is the same as the maximum payoff A can expect by playing defect.\n\nSince the maximum payoff for A is the same for both actions, the best action for A to play is the one that maximizes the chance of getting a mutual cooperation, which is to play cooperate.
