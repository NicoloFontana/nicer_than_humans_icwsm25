This creates a sense of betrayal aversion for Player A, as they cooperated and received a lower payoff than if they had defected. To avoid this feeling of betrayal, Player A may choose to defect in the current round to avoid being taken advantage of again. By defecting, Player A can ensure that they receive a higher payoff than if they were to cooperate and B were to defect.\n\nAdditionally, defecting in the current round also sends a message to Player B that defecting is not an optimal strategy, as it leads to a lower payoff for both players. This may encourage Player B to cooperate in future rounds, leading to higher payoffs for both players.\n\nIt's worth noting that this reasoning is based on the assumption that the players are rational and want to maximize their payoffs. In reality, players may have different preferences and behaviors, and their actions may not always be driven by rational thinking.",
