This creates a 5-point gap in the score.\n\nIn the second round, Player A should defect to avoid falling further behind. By defecting, Player A ensures that they won't lose any additional points, and they also have a chance to gain 5 points if Player B cooperates.\n\nThis decision is based on the concept of \"betrayal aversion,\" which suggests that people tend to avoid actions that might lead to a negative outcome, even if it means forgoing a potential positive outcome. In this case, Player A defecting in the second round prevents them from falling further behind and gives them a chance to catch up in future rounds.",
