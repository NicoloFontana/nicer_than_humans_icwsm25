1709232726:
    First run, not all info for the questions was added (missing curr_round, point got, aggregates)
20240304182346:
    Second run, add missing info.
>> 20240305134839:
    prompt v0.1, second and half run, fix some bugs.
    Time: poor performance in opponent action at round X both's points at round X. (~0.75)
    Rules: poor performance in opponent payoff per round, exists combo to get X points, which combo. (~0.75, ~0.75, ~0.4)
20240305135918:
    Attempt with imperative questions.
    No significant changes + Binz & Schulz (2023) reason to prefer questions

Change perspective from you-vs-opponent to player1-vs-player2, try to use a more code-like prompt.
>> 20240307183455:
    prompt v0.2, using JSON format. Run on fewer iterations to avoid exceeding token limit.
    Basically the same as v0.1, but it uses double the tokens
>> 20240307185046:
    prompt v0.3, for each round put into a list the action of A and the action for B. Same for the payoffs.
    Make worse own action (time) and both's #actions (aggregates)
>> 20240308162745:
    prompt v0.4, for each player put their history inside a single list.
    Much worse in the same time questions as v0.1
>> 20240308175513:
    prompt v0.5, for each player put their history inside many 10-round-long lists.
    Basically the same as v0.4

Revert to natural language prompt, but keeping the player1-vs-player2 perspective
>> 20240311115510:
    prompt v0.6, v0.1 but with different perspective
    Improves the time questions, doesn't touch the rules questions. (GOOD)
>> 20240311135514:
    prompt v0.7, add Kojima (2023) zero-shot prompting part
    Slightly worse (then v0.6) in time questions, much worse in rules and aggregates
>> 20240311140702:
    prompt v0.8, add Zhou (2023) zero-shot prompting part
    Basically as v0.7

USING v0.6 (and start saving generated text also at checkpoints)
Try to improve the performance of some rules questions.
>> 20240312151218:
    Reformulate rules questions that have poor performances.
    It shows that the LLM's bias for player1 is independent of the formulation of the question.
    No improvement is obtained for the questions about the combo of actions to get a specific payoff in a round.
>> 20240314133459:
    Try some variations of some rules questions to improve accuracy.
    There are some formulations that apparently are better.


Try to solve LLM's bias for player1 questions (which get higher accuracy than the same about player2)
>> 20240313114605:
    Change first line, from "A playing a game against B" to "A and B playing a game"
    Improvement of the player2 questions (from ~0.65 to ~0.75), but the gap with player1 still exists.
>> 20240313160040:
    Change player identifiers to more neutral ones (F, J from Binz and Schulz (2023))
    No significant change
>> 20240314150845:
    Invert player identifiers to check if the cause of the bias is the order or (somehow) the token itself.
    Confirm that the bias is due to the order in which the players are presented: the first one is preferred.

Run with all modifications to increase confidence
>> 20240315190502:
    run 0
>> 20240318120135:
    run 1
>> 20240318120155:
    run 2

Test variation of prompt to check robustness
>> 20240320130437:
    Use "neutral" identifiers for the actions
    Gives low accuracy for some questions, in particular for action of B at round X (and it also changes the format of the answer giving also a reason, while for player A that wasn't the case)

Run without questions to analyze emergent behavior
>> 20240328173931:
    More cooperate than defect (~75-25)
    "streaks" of coop/defect are more common than alternating (see transitions)
    In the first iterations defect is preferred, while later on, it goes full cooperate
>> 20240328194009:
    same as before
>> 20240328214059:
    same
>> 20240328234126:
    same
>> 20240329014202:
    much more leaned towards coop (95-5)
    But still visible that the defect are concentrated in the first iterations
